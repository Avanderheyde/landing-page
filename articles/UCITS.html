              Farmers markets encourage sustainable agriculture, offer fresh
              food, and connect communities. Nonetheless, they aren’t strictly
              necessary
              <em>anymore</em>. Historically, farmers markets solved a real
              coordination problem. Without them, if someone wanted meat, honey,
              and produce, they would have to travel to different locations. The
              invention of money made transacting for these products

                >simpler</a
              >, but not more convenient—everyone still needed to know
              <em>when and where</em> to trade. Farmers markets maximize
              liquidity by offering one location and limited hours. Today, that
              need is gone. Food can be purchased remotely or near constantly at
              grocery stores, demonstrating that farmers markets are a community
              event, not a commercial necessity.

              Stock exchanges were built for the same reason: to coordinate
              trade. Designating a venue and market hours made sense when
              trading happened face-to-face. With electronic platforms and
              global connectivity, these time restrictions are increasingly
              artificial and costly. If I want an heirloom tomato on a Tuesday
              night, I’m out of luck. If I want to buy SPY at that same time,
              I’m still out of luck—and that shouldn&#x27;t be the case. Through
              the example of UCITS, we demonstrate why traditional finance rails
              cannot easily solve this coordination problem.

              Exchanges play a crucial role in modern markets. They develop
              trading infrastructure, ensure fair practices, innovate with order
              types, and maintain market integrity. Nonetheless, their rigid
              hours and geographic constraints limit access in ways that no
              longer match how global investors actually operate. We believe
              decentralized ledger technology can solve these challenges.

              be sourced near constantly in modern markets, but trading
              boundaries lead to unnecessary costs. UCITS is like a designation
              assigned to a fund—frequently mutual funds and ETPs—to demonstrate
              that the fund meets certain provisions to trade across many
              exchanges. The designation was established initially in Europe
              since the continent is filled with local exchanges. Countries that
              approve UCITS have expanded to those as geographically distant as
              Mexico and Saudi Arabia, demonstrating that a broad range of
              currencies and time zones can support liquidity for one fund.

            <p id="1f41831a-4c5c-8072-b59f-e806d98edd38" class="">
              Compared to non-UCITS compliant securities, UCITS frequently have
              higher fees because of the regulatory complexity. For example,
              iShares issues both the US domiciled IVV and the Ireland domiciled
              CSPX, both of which track the S&amp;P 500. IVV charges 3bps
              annually whereas CSPX charges 7bps. If UK traders want the product
              currency hedged (GSPX), then the expense ratio rises to 10bps.
              These funds all trade pretty much identically from a market making
              and investment perspective, but the lack of ability to net and
              differing expense ratios represent structural inefficiencies.
            </p>
            <p id="1f91831a-4c5c-8068-bef4-dbc6d78f8f73" class="">
              (For a quick aside in this shorter article, some funds like the US
              domiciled EWJ have a much higher expense ratio than their UCITS
              counterpart [50 vs 12 bps]. We ascribe this to first mover
              advantage and the availability of other MSCI UCITS like MXJP which
              also has a fee of 12bps.)

              The baseline higher fees cover higher legal costs to ensure
              compliance, but the products trade pretty much identically across
              exchanges and hours. For investors who do not have access to US
              exchanges, these products are extremely valuable, though the
              relatively lower liquidity, regulatory hurdles, and higher fees
              obviously result in a product less desirable to trade than IVV.

              UCITS have slightly more complicated regulatory challenges than
              non-UCITS compliant securities, making up a small portion of fees.
              Nonetheless, there are many inefficiencies that are related to
              traditional finance rails that lead to undue costs on consumers.
              Take this stylized example.

              Market Maker A exists in the UK and quotes CSPX LN. During the
              day, they observe many inflows and needs to create new shares to
              flatten their short position. These shares are created at 4pm ET
              because that is when the NAV stamps. Because the markets close
              earlier in Europe than the US, they need to submit their creation
              far before US markets are closed (<a
                href="https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/literature/prospectus/ishares-vii-plc-prospectus-en.pdf"
                >page 94</a
              >). Market Maker B exists in the US and quotes IVV. They observe
              outflows and submit a redemption order. Because CSPX LN is not
              domiciled in the same location as IVV, the flows do not net so
              authorized participants receive double the fees, trading fees
              (exchange, regulatory body, etc.) are doubled, and market maker A
              (if they decided to continue trading after the cutoff) will have
              observed an extra day of holding costs if they observe the
              reversing flows.

              If markets were unified and able to trade 24/7, such as on crypto
              exchanges, these fee reversals and varying cutoff times will
              obviated. Lack of trading transparency to regulators across
              markets makes these fees necessary, enriching intermediaries who
              connect rails across countries and facilitate
              creations/redemptions. By leveraging decentralized ledger
              technology, however, regulators will have more insight into
              trading behavior, resulting in lower fees and better products.

              What can we learn from UCITS?

              UCITS exist because of market inefficiencies. Not everyone has
              access to invest in all markets, creating structural challenges
              for capital formation and allocation. Some countries do not
              support the regulations required for UCITS listing, others do not
              have expansive exchanges. Regardless, investors hoping to trade
              ETPs that track the S&amp;P 500, for instance, need to hope they
              are in the handful of countries that offer it. Those who are able
              to trade them have to pay for costly legal fees, cross-country
              interactions, and monopoly costs.

              Since UCITS are traded globally and across market hours, we see
              the coordination problem solved by exchanges should be a thing of
              the past. Market makers quote UCITS in Singapore and Chile,
              demonstrating that liquidity and pricing can be counted on around
              the clock. By continuing with fragmented liquidity across
              individual exchanges, investors lose. Regulators historically
              could dismiss these concerns over transparency and listing
              requirements, but on decentralized exchanges, global regulators
              will have the chance to develop a unified framework that can help
              enable safe trading everywhere.

            <p id="1f21831a-4c5c-8082-b463-c61f6e6fcd4e" class="">
              By creating a new class of ETPs on crypto rails, these trading
              problems can be diminished. Transparency of markets reduces the
              need for costly intermediaries and simplifies regulatory
              challenges. These exchanges can work to solve the same problems
              that they have worked on in the past: KYC/AML/compliance and
              improved trading experiences. Creating a new UCITS-like regulatory
              framework to trade across borders in these exchanges, markets will
              be a key unlock in building the market for ETPs, helping all
              parties involved in their trading except a few entrenched
              intermediaries.
